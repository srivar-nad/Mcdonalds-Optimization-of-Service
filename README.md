# 🍔 Optimizing Service Efficiency in the Fast-Food Industry – A McDonald's Case Study

This project presents a **simulation-based service optimization** study in a McDonald's restaurant using **JaamSim** and real-time queue observations. Our goal: **reduce customer wait time**, improve **resource allocation**, and boost **operational efficiency** in fast-paced food environments.



## 🧠 Problem Statement

Fast-food chains operate in high-pressure environments where time and efficiency are key. Long queues and idle employees during peak hours lead to lost revenue and poor customer experience. This study explores how to:
- 📉 Reduce queue times
- 📈 Increase resource utilization
- 💡 Optimize service configurations with simulation



## 📊 Project Summary

- **Title**: Optimizing Service Efficiency in the Fast-Food Industry: A Case Study of McDonald’s
- **Domain**: Operations Management, Simulation Modeling, Resource Optimization
- **Tools Used**: JaamSim, Excel, Monte Carlo Simulation
- **Institution**: Stetson-Hatcher School of Business


## 🔍 Methods Used

- Real-time queue observation (11AM–2PM for 3 weeks)
- Data analysis in Excel (arrival times, service times, ordering method, dine-in vs. takeout)
- Simulation modeling in **JaamSim** with:
  - Exponential & Normal distributions for customer arrivals
  - Multiple queues (drive-thru, self-order, kitchen)
  - Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate model stability
- Intervention testing (extra staff, signboard usage)
  

### ⚠️ Note on Simulation Tool

> 🚧 **This project was developed using [JaamSim](https://jaamsim.com/)** — an open-source, Java-based discrete event simulation tool.  
> You’ll need JaamSim to open and run the simulation files if they are included in this repository.

## ✅ Key Optimization Insights

| 🚀 Strategy | 📈 Impact |
|------------|-----------|
| Added employee to kitchen | ↑ Revenue by ~$100/day during peak hours |
| Digital signboard at drive-thru | ↓ Lane congestion |
| Real-time decision modeling | ↑ Efficiency from **73% to 89%** |
| Monte Carlo simulation | Validated consistency of model results |


## 📌 Final Recommendations

1. **Install a smart signboard** at the drive-thru entrance to redirect traffic to open lanes.
2. **Add a flexible employee** during peak times to manage bottlenecks in the kitchen or order taking.

These changes can significantly enhance throughput, customer satisfaction, and profitability — all simulated and validated using JaamSim and real data.
